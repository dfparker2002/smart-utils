//TODO: smart logger should have ability to select string with part of string and archive it and give it to user


2) Tool for output query result into browser. Sometimes it is very useful to get report about nodes selected by query.
Now it is a flat list of paths.

//TODO: add template support. Each template should represent an output format of single node.

For example:
  Node {path} with name '{name}' has next property value: {some_propery};

Expected result:
  Node /content/mysite/en with name 'English' has next property value: 10056;
  Node /content/mysite/fr with name 'French' has next property value: 7056;
